Here's a breakdown of the thinking process to generate the Power BI visualization plan for the auditor:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to create Power BI visualizations for an *auditor* based on a table of risk incident data from the last year. The visualizations should be *meaningful* and support the auditor's mission. The user also wants detailed steps on how to create them.

2.  **Identify the Target Audience (Auditor):** What does an auditor typically look for when reviewing risk incidents?
    *   **Financial Impact:** Where are the losses? How big are they (Gross, Net, Final)? Are there trends?
    *   **Risk Types:** What kinds of risks are occurring (Operational, Reputation, etc.)? Are certain types more frequent or costly?
    *   **Control Weaknesses/Causes:** Why are these incidents happening (Process failures, IT issues, human error - inferred from descriptions/codes)?
    *   **Timeliness:** How quickly are incidents discovered, validated, and closed? Are there backlogs?
    *   **Responsibility/Location:** Which departments, countries, or processes are most affected or responsible?
    *   **Status:** How many incidents are open, closed, or validated?
    *   **Compliance/Conduct:** Are there specific conduct risks flagged?
    *   **Data Quality:** (Implicit) Are the records complete and consistent?

3.  **Analyze the Provided Data:** Review the table columns and example data to see what information is available to address the auditor's needs.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_ID`: Unique identifier. Good for counting distinct incidents.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_REFERENCE_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_CREATION_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_DISCOVERY_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_FIRST_VALIDATION_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_LAST_VALIDATION_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_CLOSED_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_FIRST_BOOKING_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_OCCURENCE_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_END_OF_OCCURRENCE_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_LAST_UPDATE`: Lots of dates! These are crucial for timeline analysis, calculating durations (time to detect, time to close), and filtering by period (e.g., last year).
    *   `RISKEVENTTITLE`, `RISKEVENTDESCRIPTION`: Text descriptions. Useful for context, potentially for text analytics (if more data), but harder to visualize directly beyond tables or tooltips.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN`: Categorical. Excellent for segmenting data (e.g., pie chart of statuses, filtering).
    *   `RISK_EVENT_CONFIDENTIALITY_LEVEL`: Categorical. Might be relevant for sensitivity analysis, but maybe less critical for core audit themes unless specific controls around confidentiality are being audited.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_GROSS_AMOUNT`, `RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_NET_AMOUNT`, `RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT`: Numerical. Key financial metrics. Perfect for aggregations (sum, average) and trends. Need to understand the difference (Gross vs. Net vs. Final - likely relates to recoveries/insurance). `RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_AMOUNT_IN_EURO` seems related, possibly at a more granular impact level. Need to clarify which amount is most relevant (often Final Net Loss). Let's assume `RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT` is the key one for overall loss.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_CONDUCT_RISK`: Boolean (YES/NO). Important flag for compliance/conduct audits.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_TYPE`: Categorical (Operational, Reputation). Very important for classifying risks.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_PROCESS_CODE`, `RISK_EVENT_MACRO_PROCESS_CODE`, `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_ACTIVITY_CODE`: Categorical codes. Useful for identifying problematic processes/activities.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_RESPONSIBLE_LRE`, `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_RESPONSIBLE_OU`, `RISK_EVENT_IMPACTED_LRE`, `RISK_EVENT_IMPACTED_OU`, `RISK_EVENT_ADDITIONAL_RESP_OU`, `RISK_EVENT_ADDITIONAL_RESPONSIB_LRE`: Categorical identifiers for Legal Reporting Entities (LREs) and Organizational Units (OUs). Essential for assigning responsibility/impact.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_RESPONSIBLE_COUN`, `RISK_EVENT_IMPACTED_COUNTRY`, `RISK_EVENT_IMPACTED_ADDITIONNAL_CNTRY`, `RISK_EVENT_DECLARING_COUNTRY_CODE`: Geographical information. Good for mapping or segmenting by location.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_SOURCE`: Categorical. Where was the risk identified (e.g., T2M/ORE)? Important for understanding detection mechanisms.
    *   Other fields: `RISK_EVENT_INDICATOR_AGGR_LOSS`, `RISK_EVENT_AGGR_NO_OF_OCCURENCES`, `RISK_EVENT_SERVICE_PROVIDER`, `RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_REFERENCE_DATE`, etc. Some might be useful for specific deep dives, but let's focus on the core audit needs first.

4.  **Brainstorm Potential Visualizations:** Based on the auditor's needs and available data, what charts make sense?
    *   **Overall Summary:** KPIs (Total Incidents, Total Loss, Avg Loss, Open Incidents). *Use Card visuals.*
    *   **Financial Impact:** Total Loss by Risk Type, by OU, by Country, by Process. Trend of Total Loss over time. Distribution of loss amounts. *Use Bar charts, Line charts, Tree maps, Scatter plots (maybe loss vs frequency).*
    *   **Frequency/Volume:** Number of Incidents by Risk Type, by OU, by Country, by Status, by Process. Trend of Incident Count over time. *Use Bar charts, Pie charts (for status), Line charts.*
    *   **Timeliness:** Average time from Discovery to Closure, Average time from Occurrence to Discovery. Distribution of incident ages (for open incidents). *Calculate duration measures (using DAX). Use Bar charts, Line charts, Histograms.*
    *   **Risk Categories:** Breakdown by `RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_TYPE`. Maybe combine with loss amount. *Use Bar/Column charts, Treemaps.*
    *   **Location:** Loss/Count by Country/OU. *Use Bar charts, Maps (if country codes are clean).*
    *   **Status Tracking:** Count of incidents by `RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN`. *Use Pie chart or Donut chart.*
    *   **Conduct Risk:** Filter/Highlight incidents flagged as `RISK_EVENT_CONDUCT_RISK = YES`. Maybe a separate KPI card for count/loss of conduct risk events.
    *   **Detailed View:** A table visual to show raw data for selected incidents.

5.  **Select Key Visualizations for the Auditor:** Choose a set that covers the main audit themes efficiently. Prioritize clarity and impact.
    *   **Dashboard Overview:** KPIs are essential.
    *   **Financial Focus:** Loss by key dimensions (Type, OU/Dept, Time).
    *   **Frequency Focus:** Count by key dimensions (Type, OU/Dept, Time, Status).
    *   **Timeliness:** Average resolution time.
    *   **Specific Concerns:** Conduct Risk highlight.
    *   **Drill-down:** A table for details.

6.  **Structure the Power BI Report:** Organize the visuals logically. A common approach is:
    *   **Page 1: Executive Summary:** KPIs, high-level trends (Loss/Count over time), breakdown by top categories (Risk Type, Status).
    *   **Page 2: Financial Deep Dive:** Loss breakdown by OU, Country, Process. Maybe a treemap for visual impact.
    *   **Page 3: Operational View / Timeliness:** Incident counts, status breakdown, time-to-resolve metrics.
    *   **Page 4: Details:** A filterable table.

7.  **Outline the Steps for Creation (Detailed):** This is crucial for the user request. Break down the process within Power BI:
    *   **Data Connection & Loading:** Get Data -> Specify Source (Excel, CSV, DB) -> Select Table -> Load.
    *   **Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query):**
        *   Check data types (especially Dates and Numbers).
        *   Handle nulls/blanks (replace, remove?).
        *   Rename columns for clarity.
        *   Split/Merge columns if needed.
        *   *Crucially:* Create calculated columns for durations (e.g., `TimeToClose = DATEDIFF(RISK_EVENT_DISCOVERY_DATE, RISK_EVENT_CLOSED_DATE, DAY)`). Handle cases where `RISK_EVENT_CLOSED_DATE` is blank.
        *   Create a dedicated Date table (recommended best practice for time intelligence). Mark it as a date table. Create relationships.
    *   **Data Modeling:**
        *   Define relationships (especially if using a Date table or related lookup tables, though here it's one flat table initially).
    *   **Creating Measures (DAX):**
        *   `Total Incidents = COUNTROWS('RiskIncidents')` or `DISTINCTCOUNT('RiskIncidents'[RISK_EVENT_ID])`
        *   `Total Final Loss = SUM('RiskIncidents'[RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT])`
        *   `Average Final Loss = AVERAGE('RiskIncidents'[RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT])`
        *   `Open Incidents = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('RiskIncidents'), 'RiskIncidents'[RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN] <> "Closed")` (Adjust status text as needed)
        *   `Avg Time To Close = AVERAGE('RiskIncidents'[TimeToClose])` (Using the calculated column)
        *   `Conduct Risk Incidents = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('RiskIncidents'), 'RiskIncidents'[RISK_EVENT_CONDUCT_RISK] = "YES")`
        *   `Conduct Risk Loss = CALCULATE(SUM('RiskIncidents'[RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT]), 'RiskIncidents'[RISK_EVENT_CONDUCT_RISK] = "YES")`
    *   **Building Visualizations:**
        *   Add visuals from the Visualizations pane.
        *   Drag fields/measures onto the visual wells (Axis, Legend, Values, Tooltips).
        *   Configure formatting (titles, labels, colors, etc.).
        *   Add Slicers for filtering (Date Range, Status, OU, Country, Risk Type).
        *   Set up interactions between visuals (highlighting, filtering).
    *   **Report Refinement:**
        *   Add titles, text boxes for explanations.
        *   Ensure consistent styling.
        *   Check tooltips for clarity.
        *   Test filtering and interactions.
        *   Publish and share.

8.  **Refine and Format:** Review the generated steps and visualization descriptions. Ensure they are clear, address the auditor's perspective, and directly link back to the provided data fields. Add context about *why* each visualization is useful for the auditor. Emphasize data quality checks and the importance of using the *correct* loss amount field. Add notes on best practices like using a Date table and DAX measures. Add a concluding remark about tailoring the report further based on specific audit scope.

2. **Recurring Issues**: Use the `RISK_EVENT_AGGR_NO_OF_OCCURENCES` to flag repeat offenders.  
3. **Open vs. Closed**: Highlight unresolved incidents using the status filter.  

By following these steps, auditors can quickly identify high-risk areas, financial exposures, and trends to prioritize their audit activities.




I'll help you analyze this risk incident data and create meaningful visualizations in Power BI for auditors. Let me outline a detailed approach for creating visualizations that would effectively support an audit mission.

# Power BI Visualization Plan for Risk Incident Analysis

Based on the provided risk incident data, here are the steps to create meaningful visualizations in Power BI:

## Step 1: Data Import and Preparation

1. **Import the data into Power BI**:
   - Open Power BI Desktop
   - Click "Get Data" → "Text/CSV"
   - Browse to the file location and import your risk incident data
   - If the data needs additional formatting, use Power Query Editor

2. **Clean and transform the data**:
   - Fix any data type issues (ensure dates are formatted correctly)
   - Create calculated columns for better analysis:
     - Time to close (days between RISK_EVENT_CREATION_DATE and RISK_EVENT_CLOSED_DATE)
     - Time to validate (days between RISK_EVENT_CREATION_DATE and RISK_EVENT_FIRST_VALIDATION_DATE)
     - Loss amounts categorization (create buckets based on amount ranges)
     - Extract month and quarter from dates for time-based analysis

## Step 2: Create a Risk Incident Dashboard

### Visualization 1: Risk Incident Status Overview
1. Create a card visual showing total number of incidents
2. Add a donut chart displaying distribution by RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN
3. Implement steps:
   - Drag "RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN" to the Legend field
   - Use a count of RISK_EVENT_ID for the Values field
   - Format with appropriate colors (Red for Open, Yellow for Validated, Green for Closed)

### Visualization 2: Financial Impact Analysis
1. Create a bar chart showing total loss amounts by impact type:
   - Drag "RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_TYPE" to Axis
   - Drag "RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_GROSS_AMOUNT" to Values
   - Sort by amount in descending order

2. Add a matrix showing:
   - Rows: RISK_EVENT_MAIN_RESPONSIBLE_LRE
   - Columns: Sum of RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_GROSS_AMOUNT, RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_NET_AMOUNT, and RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT
   - Apply conditional formatting to highlight significant losses

### Visualization 3: Geographical Distribution
1. Create a map visualization:
   - Drag "RISK_EVENT_IMPACTED_COUNTRY" to Location
   - Use count of RISK_EVENT_ID or sum of loss amounts for the size of bubbles
   - Implement by using the Map visual and configuring country codes to work with Power BI's mapping

### Visualization 4: Time Series Analysis
1. Create a line chart showing incidents over time:
   - Drag "RISK_EVENT_REFERENCE_DATE" to Axis (formatted by month)
   - Drag count of RISK_EVENT_ID to Values
   - Add a trend line for pattern identification

2. Add a timeline slicer:
   - Drag "RISK_EVENT_REFERENCE_DATE" to a timeline slicer
   - Format to allow for flexible date range selection
   - Connect to all visuals for interactive filtering

### Visualization 5: Process and Activity Breakdown
1. Create a treemap showing incident distribution:
   - First level: RISK_EVENT_MACRO_PROCESS_CODE
   - Second level: RISK_EVENT_MAIN_PROCESS_CODE
   - Third level: RISK_EVENT_MAIN_ACTIVITY_CODE
   - Size by count of incidents or sum of loss amounts

### Visualization 6: Risk Resolution Efficiency
1. Create a scatter plot:
   - X-axis: Average time to validate (days)
   - Y-axis: Average time to close (days)
   - Details: RISK_EVENT_MAIN_RESPONSIBLE_OU
   - Size: Count of incidents
   - Color: Average loss amount

## Step 3: Create Interactive Elements

1. **Add Slicers and Filters**:
   - Time period slicer (reference date)
   - Confidentiality level filter
   - Risk event status filter
   - Responsible unit filter

2. **Create Drill-through Pages**:
   - Set up a detailed incident page
   - Allow users to drill down from summary visuals to specific incident details
   - Include incident description, timeline, and response actions

## Step 4: Add Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. Create cards or gauges for:
   - Average time to close incidents
   - Percentage of incidents with financial impact
   - Total loss amount against target/threshold
   - Incident recurrence rate

2. Implementation:
   - Use DAX measures to calculate these metrics
   - Create card visuals for each KPI
   - Add appropriate conditional formatting (red/yellow/green)

## Step 5: Create Audit-Specific Views

1. **Non-Compliance Report**:
   - Filter incidents related to regulatory penalties
   - Show trends over time
   - Highlight responsible departments

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Extract common themes from RISKEVENTDESCRIPTION using text analysis
   - Create a word cloud or categorized view of common causes
   - For implementation, use Power BI's text analytics features or pre-process the data

3. **Control Effectiveness Dashboard**:
   - Compare time to discovery vs. occurrence date
   - Show percentage of self-identified vs. externally reported incidents
   - Track remediation actions and their effectiveness

## Step 6: Format and Publish the Report

1. **Apply consistent formatting**:
   - Use a consistent color scheme
   - Add appropriate titles and legends
   - Include helpful tooltips with additional information

2. **Set up automatic refresh**:
   - Configure data refresh schedule
   - Set up alerts for critical thresholds

3. **Publish to Power BI Service**:
   - Share with auditors with appropriate permissions
   - Set up row-level security if needed for confidential data

## Step 7: Documentation for Auditors

1. Create a guidance page in the report:
   - Explain how to interpret each visualization
   - Document any assumptions or data transformations
   - Provide context for key findings

Would you like me to explain any of these visualizations in more detail or provide additional recommendations for your audit support dashboard?
