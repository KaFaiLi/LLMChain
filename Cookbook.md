Okay, acting as a Data Analyst, let's design some meaningful Power BI visualizations based on your risk incident data for an auditor. Auditors typically focus on financial impact, trends, risk categories, control effectiveness (inferred from timeliness and root causes), and areas of responsibility.

**Goal:** Provide auditors with insights into the risk landscape, highlighting key areas of concern like high-loss events, recurring issues, slow resolution times, and distribution across the organization.

**Key Data Fields We'll Focus On:**

*   **Dates:** `RISK_EVENT_OCCURENCE_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_DISCOVERY_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_CLOSED_DATE` (for trends and timeliness)
*   **Financials:** `RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT` (assuming this is the most relevant loss figure after recoveries/adjustments)
*   **Categorization:** `RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_TYPE`, `RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN`, `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_PROCESS_CODE`, `RISK_EVENT_CONDUCT_RISK`
*   **Responsibility/Location:** `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_RESPONSIBLE_OU`, `RISK_EVENT_IMPACTED_OU`, `RISK_EVENT_IMPACTED_COUNTRY`
*   **Identifiers:** `RISK_EVENT_ID` (for counting distinct events)

2.  **Page 2: Financial Impact Analysis** (Deep dive into losses)
3.  **Page 3: Operational & Timeliness Analysis** (Focus on volume, status, and resolution speed)
4.  **Page 4: Detailed Incident Listing** (Filterable table for specific event review)

**Visualizations & Step-by-Step Creation:**

**Prerequisites:**

*   You have Power BI Desktop installed.
*   Your risk incident data is accessible (e.g., in an Excel file, CSV, or database).

**General Steps (Apply Before Creating Specific Visuals):**

1.  **Get Data:**
    *   Open Power BI Desktop.
    *   Click `Get Data` on the Home ribbon.
    *   Choose the appropriate source (e.g., `Excel Workbook`, `Text/CSV`, `SQL Server`).
    *   Navigate to your file/server and select the table/sheet containing the risk data.
    *   Click `Load`. If the data looks clean, loading directly is okay. If it needs cleaning (e.g., fixing date formats, handling blanks), click `Transform Data` to open Power Query Editor first.

2.  **Data Transformation (Power Query - If needed):**
    *   **Check Data Types:** Select each column and ensure the data type is correct (e.g., Dates should be `Date` or `Date/Time`, Loss amounts should be `Decimal Number` or `Fixed decimal number`, IDs should be `Text` or `Whole Number`). Pay special attention to date columns.
    *   **Handle Blanks/Nulls:** Decide how to handle blanks in key fields (e.g., replace null loss amounts with 0 if appropriate, or leave them null but be aware during calculations).
    *   **Rename Columns:** Right-click column headers and rename them for better readability if needed (e.g., `RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT` to `Final Loss Amount`).
    *   **Create Duration Columns (Crucial for Timeliness):**
        *   Select `RISK_EVENT_DISCOVERY_DATE` and `RISK_EVENT_CLOSED_DATE` columns (use Ctrl+Click).
        *   Go to the `Add Column` tab.
        *   Click `Date` -> `Subtract Days`. This creates a `Duration` column (Time to Close). Rename it `Days to Close`. *Note: This will only work for closed events. You might need DAX later for more complex handling.*
        *   Repeat for `RISK_EVENT_OCCURENCE_DATE` and `RISK_EVENT_DISCOVERY_DATE` to get `Days to Discover`.
    *   Click `Close & Apply` on the Home ribbon in Power Query Editor.

3.  **Data Modeling (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   **Create a Date Table:** For robust time intelligence, create a dedicated Date table.
        *   Go to the `Modeling` tab -> `New Table`.
        *   Enter DAX formula: `DimDate = CALENDARAUTO()` or `DimDate = CALENDAR(MIN('YourRiskTable'[RISK_EVENT_OCCURENCE_DATE]), MAX('YourRiskTable'[RISK_EVENT_OCCURENCE_DATE]))`
        *   Add columns to the Date table (Year, Month, Quarter, MonthName, etc.) using DAX calculated columns (e.g., `Year = YEAR(DimDate[Date])`).
        *   Mark it as a Date Table: Select the table, go to `Table tools` -> `Mark as date table`. Choose the main date column.
        *   Create Relationships: Go to the `Model` view. Drag the date column from your main risk table (e.g., `RISK_EVENT_OCCURENCE_DATE`) onto the `Date` column in your `DimDate` table. Repeat for other key dates if needed (Discovery, Closed), creating inactive relationships you can activate with DAX if necessary.

4.  **Create Base Measures (DAX):** Using measures is more flexible than implicit calculations.
    *   Go to the `Home` tab -> `New Measure`.
    *   `Total Incidents = DISTINCTCOUNT('YourRiskTable'[RISK_EVENT_ID])`
    *   `Total Final Loss = SUM('YourRiskTable'[Final Loss Amount])` (Use the column name you chose)
    *   `Avg Final Loss = AVERAGE('YourRiskTable'[Final Loss Amount])`
    *   `Avg Days to Close = AVERAGE('YourRiskTable'[Days to Close])`
    *   `Open Incidents = CALCULATE([Total Incidents], 'YourRiskTable'[RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN] <> "Closed")` (Adjust "Closed" text if needed)

---

**Page 3: Operational & Timeliness Analysis**

*   **Purpose:** Focus on incident volume, status progression, and how quickly events are handled.

    1.  **Incident Count Trend Over Time (Occurrence vs. Discovery vs. Closed):**
        *   **Visual:** `Line Chart`
        *   **Steps:**
            *   Add the visual to the canvas.
            *   Drag your Date Table's Month/Year hierarchy to the `Axis`.
            *   Create separate measures for counts based on different dates:
                *   `Incidents by Occurrence = CALCULATE([Total Incidents], USERELATIONSHIP(DimDate[Date], 'YourRiskTable'[RISK_EVENT_OCCURENCE_DATE]))`
                *   `Incidents by Discovery = CALCULATE([Total Incidents], USERELATIONSHIP(DimDate[Date], 'YourRiskTable'[RISK_EVENT_DISCOVERY_DATE]))`
                *   `Incidents Closed = CALCULATE([Total Incidents], USERELATIONSHIP(DimDate[Date], 'YourRiskTable'[RISK_EVENT_CLOSED_DATE]), 'YourRiskTable'[RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN] = "Closed")`
            *   Drag these three measures onto the `Values` well. *(Requires inactive relationships set up in Model View if using one Date table)*. Alternatively, create 3 separate charts if easier.
        *   **Auditor Value:** Compares when events happen vs. when they are found vs. when they are closed. Gaps can indicate detection or resolution delays.

    2.  **Average Days to Discover & Average Days to Close by Risk Impact Type:**
        *   **Visual:** `Clustered Bar Chart`
        *   **Steps:**
            *   Add the visual to the canvas.
            *   Drag `RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_TYPE` to the `Axis`.
            *   Create measures for average durations if not already done:
                *   `Avg Days to Discover = AVERAGE('YourRiskTable'[Days to Discover])`
                *   `Avg Days to Close = AVERAGE('YourRiskTable'[Days to Close])`
            *   Drag `Avg Days to Discover` and `Avg Days to Close` to `Values`.
        *   **Auditor Value:** Highlights if certain risk types take longer to detect or resolve, potentially indicating process or control weaknesses specific to those types.

    3.  **Distribution of Open Incident Age:**
        *   **Visual:** `Histogram` (requires creating bins) or `Bar Chart` with calculated age groups.
        *   **Steps (Calculated Age Groups):**
            *   Create a Calculated Column in your main table (DAX):
                `Open Incident Age Group = IF(ISBLANK('YourRiskTable'[RISK_EVENT_CLOSED_DATE]), SWITCH(TRUE(), DATEDIFF('YourRiskTable'[RISK_EVENT_DISCOVERY_DATE], TODAY(), DAY) <= 30, "0-30 Days", DATEDIFF('YourRiskTable'[RISK_EVENT_DISCOVERY_DATE], TODAY(), DAY) <= 90, "31-90 Days", DATEDIFF('YourRiskTable'[RISK_EVENT_DISCOVERY_DATE], TODAY(), DAY) <= 180, "91-180 Days", "> 180 Days", BLANK()), BLANK())`
            *   Add a `Bar Chart`.
            *   Drag `Open Incident Age Group` to the `Axis`.
            *   Drag `Total Incidents` measure to `Values`.
            *   Filter the visual/page for Status <> "Closed".
        *   **Auditor Value:** Shows how many open incidents are aging, indicating potential backlog issues and delays in resolution.

    4.  **Filter Slicers:**
        *   **Visual:** `Slicer`
        *   **Steps:** Add slicers for `RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN`, `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_RESPONSIBLE_OU`.
        *   **Auditor Value:** Allows filtering timeliness and volume data by status or department.

**Page 4: Detailed Incident Listing**

*   **Purpose:** Provide access to the raw data for specific investigation, driven by filters.

    1.  **Incident Details Table:**
        *   **Visual:** `Table`
        *   **Steps:**
            *   Add the `Table` visual to the canvas. Make it large.
            *   Drag relevant fields into the `Columns` well. Start with:
                *   `RISK_EVENT_ID`
                *   `RISKEVENTTITLE`
                *   `RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN`
                *   `RISK_EVENT_OCCURENCE_DATE`
                *   `RISK_EVENT_DISCOVERY_DATE`
                *   `RISK_EVENT_CLOSED_DATE`
                *   `Final Loss Amount`
                *   `RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_TYPE`
                *   `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_RESPONSIBLE_OU`
                *   `RISK_EVENT_IMPACTED_COUNTRY`
                *   `RISK_EVENT_CONDUCT_RISK`
                *   `RISKEVENTDESCRIPTION` (Place last as it can be long)
            *   Enable word wrap for the description column in the Formatting options.
        *   **Auditor Value:** Allows the auditor to see the specific details of incidents after filtering on other pages or using slicers on this page. Essential for sample selection and detailed testing.

    2.  **Filter Slicers:**
        *   **Visual:** `Slicer`
        *   **Steps:** Add slicers for the most common fields an auditor might want to filter by: Date Range, Status, Risk Impact Type, Responsible OU, Impacted Country, Conduct Risk, potentially a search box for Title/ID.
        *   **Auditor Value:** Enables targeted selection of incidents for review.

---

**Final Touches:**

*   **Titles & Labels:** Ensure all visuals have clear, descriptive titles and axis labels.
*   **Formatting:** Use consistent colors and formatting. Highlight key findings where appropriate (e.g., conditional formatting on tables/charts for high loss amounts).
*   **Interactions:** Ensure visuals on a page filter each other appropriately (default setting usually works well). Clicking a bar on one chart should filter the others.
*   **Tooltips:** Customize tooltips to show relevant extra information when hovering over data points.
*   **Publish:** Publish the report to the Power BI service for sharing with the auditors (ensure appropriate security/permissions).

This comprehensive set of visualizations provides a multi-faceted view of the risk incident data, addressing key areas an auditor would likely investigate. Remember to validate the data and calculations, and be prepared to explain the source and meaning of each visualization.

Here's a breakdown of the thinking process to generate the Power BI visualization plan for the auditor:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to create Power BI visualizations for an *auditor* based on a table of risk incident data from the last year. The visualizations should be *meaningful* and support the auditor's mission. The user also wants detailed steps on how to create them.

2.  **Identify the Target Audience (Auditor):** What does an auditor typically look for when reviewing risk incidents?
    *   **Financial Impact:** Where are the losses? How big are they (Gross, Net, Final)? Are there trends?
    *   **Risk Types:** What kinds of risks are occurring (Operational, Reputation, etc.)? Are certain types more frequent or costly?
    *   **Control Weaknesses/Causes:** Why are these incidents happening (Process failures, IT issues, human error - inferred from descriptions/codes)?
    *   **Timeliness:** How quickly are incidents discovered, validated, and closed? Are there backlogs?
    *   **Responsibility/Location:** Which departments, countries, or processes are most affected or responsible?
    *   **Status:** How many incidents are open, closed, or validated?
    *   **Compliance/Conduct:** Are there specific conduct risks flagged?
    *   **Data Quality:** (Implicit) Are the records complete and consistent?

3.  **Analyze the Provided Data:** Review the table columns and example data to see what information is available to address the auditor's needs.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_ID`: Unique identifier. Good for counting distinct incidents.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_REFERENCE_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_CREATION_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_DISCOVERY_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_FIRST_VALIDATION_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_LAST_VALIDATION_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_CLOSED_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_FIRST_BOOKING_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_OCCURENCE_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_END_OF_OCCURRENCE_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_LAST_UPDATE`: Lots of dates! These are crucial for timeline analysis, calculating durations (time to detect, time to close), and filtering by period (e.g., last year).
    *   `RISKEVENTTITLE`, `RISKEVENTDESCRIPTION`: Text descriptions. Useful for context, potentially for text analytics (if more data), but harder to visualize directly beyond tables or tooltips.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN`: Categorical. Excellent for segmenting data (e.g., pie chart of statuses, filtering).
    *   `RISK_EVENT_CONFIDENTIALITY_LEVEL`: Categorical. Might be relevant for sensitivity analysis, but maybe less critical for core audit themes unless specific controls around confidentiality are being audited.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_GROSS_AMOUNT`, `RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_NET_AMOUNT`, `RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT`: Numerical. Key financial metrics. Perfect for aggregations (sum, average) and trends. Need to understand the difference (Gross vs. Net vs. Final - likely relates to recoveries/insurance). `RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_AMOUNT_IN_EURO` seems related, possibly at a more granular impact level. Need to clarify which amount is most relevant (often Final Net Loss). Let's assume `RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT` is the key one for overall loss.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_CONDUCT_RISK`: Boolean (YES/NO). Important flag for compliance/conduct audits.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_TYPE`: Categorical (Operational, Reputation). Very important for classifying risks.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_PROCESS_CODE`, `RISK_EVENT_MACRO_PROCESS_CODE`, `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_ACTIVITY_CODE`: Categorical codes. Useful for identifying problematic processes/activities.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_RESPONSIBLE_LRE`, `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_RESPONSIBLE_OU`, `RISK_EVENT_IMPACTED_LRE`, `RISK_EVENT_IMPACTED_OU`, `RISK_EVENT_ADDITIONAL_RESP_OU`, `RISK_EVENT_ADDITIONAL_RESPONSIB_LRE`: Categorical identifiers for Legal Reporting Entities (LREs) and Organizational Units (OUs). Essential for assigning responsibility/impact.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_RESPONSIBLE_COUN`, `RISK_EVENT_IMPACTED_COUNTRY`, `RISK_EVENT_IMPACTED_ADDITIONNAL_CNTRY`, `RISK_EVENT_DECLARING_COUNTRY_CODE`: Geographical information. Good for mapping or segmenting by location.
    *   `RISK_EVENT_SOURCE`: Categorical. Where was the risk identified (e.g., T2M/ORE)? Important for understanding detection mechanisms.
    *   Other fields: `RISK_EVENT_INDICATOR_AGGR_LOSS`, `RISK_EVENT_AGGR_NO_OF_OCCURENCES`, `RISK_EVENT_SERVICE_PROVIDER`, `RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_REFERENCE_DATE`, etc. Some might be useful for specific deep dives, but let's focus on the core audit needs first.

4.  **Brainstorm Potential Visualizations:** Based on the auditor's needs and available data, what charts make sense?
    *   **Overall Summary:** KPIs (Total Incidents, Total Loss, Avg Loss, Open Incidents). *Use Card visuals.*
    *   **Financial Impact:** Total Loss by Risk Type, by OU, by Country, by Process. Trend of Total Loss over time. Distribution of loss amounts. *Use Bar charts, Line charts, Tree maps, Scatter plots (maybe loss vs frequency).*
    *   **Frequency/Volume:** Number of Incidents by Risk Type, by OU, by Country, by Status, by Process. Trend of Incident Count over time. *Use Bar charts, Pie charts (for status), Line charts.*
    *   **Timeliness:** Average time from Discovery to Closure, Average time from Occurrence to Discovery. Distribution of incident ages (for open incidents). *Calculate duration measures (using DAX). Use Bar charts, Line charts, Histograms.*
    *   **Risk Categories:** Breakdown by `RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_TYPE`. Maybe combine with loss amount. *Use Bar/Column charts, Treemaps.*
    *   **Location:** Loss/Count by Country/OU. *Use Bar charts, Maps (if country codes are clean).*
    *   **Status Tracking:** Count of incidents by `RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN`. *Use Pie chart or Donut chart.*
    *   **Conduct Risk:** Filter/Highlight incidents flagged as `RISK_EVENT_CONDUCT_RISK = YES`. Maybe a separate KPI card for count/loss of conduct risk events.
    *   **Detailed View:** A table visual to show raw data for selected incidents.

5.  **Select Key Visualizations for the Auditor:** Choose a set that covers the main audit themes efficiently. Prioritize clarity and impact.
    *   **Dashboard Overview:** KPIs are essential.
    *   **Financial Focus:** Loss by key dimensions (Type, OU/Dept, Time).
    *   **Frequency Focus:** Count by key dimensions (Type, OU/Dept, Time, Status).
    *   **Timeliness:** Average resolution time.
    *   **Specific Concerns:** Conduct Risk highlight.
    *   **Drill-down:** A table for details.

6.  **Structure the Power BI Report:** Organize the visuals logically. A common approach is:
    *   **Page 1: Executive Summary:** KPIs, high-level trends (Loss/Count over time), breakdown by top categories (Risk Type, Status).
    *   **Page 2: Financial Deep Dive:** Loss breakdown by OU, Country, Process. Maybe a treemap for visual impact.
    *   **Page 3: Operational View / Timeliness:** Incident counts, status breakdown, time-to-resolve metrics.
    *   **Page 4: Details:** A filterable table.

7.  **Outline the Steps for Creation (Detailed):** This is crucial for the user request. Break down the process within Power BI:
    *   **Data Connection & Loading:** Get Data -> Specify Source (Excel, CSV, DB) -> Select Table -> Load.
    *   **Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query):**
        *   Check data types (especially Dates and Numbers).
        *   Handle nulls/blanks (replace, remove?).
        *   Rename columns for clarity.
        *   Split/Merge columns if needed.
        *   *Crucially:* Create calculated columns for durations (e.g., `TimeToClose = DATEDIFF(RISK_EVENT_DISCOVERY_DATE, RISK_EVENT_CLOSED_DATE, DAY)`). Handle cases where `RISK_EVENT_CLOSED_DATE` is blank.
        *   Create a dedicated Date table (recommended best practice for time intelligence). Mark it as a date table. Create relationships.
    *   **Data Modeling:**
        *   Define relationships (especially if using a Date table or related lookup tables, though here it's one flat table initially).
    *   **Creating Measures (DAX):**
        *   `Total Incidents = COUNTROWS('RiskIncidents')` or `DISTINCTCOUNT('RiskIncidents'[RISK_EVENT_ID])`
        *   `Total Final Loss = SUM('RiskIncidents'[RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT])`
        *   `Average Final Loss = AVERAGE('RiskIncidents'[RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT])`
        *   `Open Incidents = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('RiskIncidents'), 'RiskIncidents'[RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN] <> "Closed")` (Adjust status text as needed)
        *   `Avg Time To Close = AVERAGE('RiskIncidents'[TimeToClose])` (Using the calculated column)
        *   `Conduct Risk Incidents = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('RiskIncidents'), 'RiskIncidents'[RISK_EVENT_CONDUCT_RISK] = "YES")`
        *   `Conduct Risk Loss = CALCULATE(SUM('RiskIncidents'[RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT]), 'RiskIncidents'[RISK_EVENT_CONDUCT_RISK] = "YES")`
    *   **Building Visualizations:**
        *   Add visuals from the Visualizations pane.
        *   Drag fields/measures onto the visual wells (Axis, Legend, Values, Tooltips).
        *   Configure formatting (titles, labels, colors, etc.).
        *   Add Slicers for filtering (Date Range, Status, OU, Country, Risk Type).
        *   Set up interactions between visuals (highlighting, filtering).
    *   **Report Refinement:**
        *   Add titles, text boxes for explanations.
        *   Ensure consistent styling.
        *   Check tooltips for clarity.
        *   Test filtering and interactions.
        *   Publish and share.

8.  **Refine and Format:** Review the generated steps and visualization descriptions. Ensure they are clear, address the auditor's perspective, and directly link back to the provided data fields. Add context about *why* each visualization is useful for the auditor. Emphasize data quality checks and the importance of using the *correct* loss amount field. Add notes on best practices like using a Date table and DAX measures. Add a concluding remark about tailoring the report further based on specific audit scope.



To create meaningful visualizations in Power BI for auditors analyzing risk incidents, follow these detailed steps:

---

### **Step 1: Data Preparation**
1. **Import Data**  
   - Open Power BI Desktop.  
   - Go to **Home** > **Get Data** > **Excel/CSV** (or your data source).  
   - Load the risk incident dataset.  

2. **Clean and Transform Data**  
   - Open **Power Query Editor** (Transform Data).  
     - Ensure all date columns (e.g., `RISK_EVENT_OCCURENCE_DATE`, `RISK_EVENT_CLOSED_DATE`) are formatted as **Date**.  
     - Convert numeric fields (e.g., `RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT`) to **Decimal**.  
     - Check for missing values and duplicates.  
     - Split `RISKEVENTTITLE` into categories if needed (e.g., extract "CIF penalty" as a subcategory).  

---

### **Step 2: Create Key Visualizations**
#### **1. Incidents Over Time**  
**Purpose**: Track incident trends by occurrence, discovery, and closure dates.  
- **Visual**: **Line Chart**  
  - **X-axis**: `RISK_EVENT_OCCURENCE_DATE` (or `RISK_EVENT_DISCOVERY_DATE`).  
  - **Y-axis**: Count of `RISK_EVENT_ID` (aggregate as "Number of Incidents").  
  - **Legend**: Split by `RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN` (e.g., Closed, Validated).  

#### **2. Financial Impact Analysis**  
**Purpose**: Highlight incidents with the highest financial loss.  
- **Visual**: **Treemap** or **Clustered Bar Chart**  
  - **Category**: `RISKEVENTTITLE` or `RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_TYPE` (e.g., Operational, Reputation).  
  - **Value**: Sum of `RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT`.  
  - Add tooltips for `RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_COMMENT` to show root causes.  

#### **3. Incident Status Distribution**  
**Purpose**: Show the proportion of incidents by status.  
- **Visual**: **Donut Chart**  
  - **Legend**: `RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN`.

  - **Legend**: `RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN`.  
  - **Size**: Count of `RISK_EVENT_ID` or sum of loss amounts.  

#### **5. Process/Activity Code Analysis**  
**Purpose**: Identify high-risk processes.  
- **Visual**: **Stacked Column Chart**  
  - **X-axis**: `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_PROCESS_CODE` (e.g., 068.02_[A25.03.01]).  
  - **Y-axis**: Count of incidents.  
  - **Breakdown**: `RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_TYPE`.  

#### **6. Responsible Departments**  
**Purpose**: Highlight departments/units with recurring incidents.  
- **Visual**: **Horizontal Bar Chart**  
  - **Y-axis**: `RISK_EVENT_MAIN_RESPONSIBLE_OU` (e.g., SG CORPORATE SERVICES).  
  - **X-axis**: Count of incidents.  
  - Sort bars descending for clarity.  

#### **7. Loss Amount vs. Incident Type**  
**Purpose**: Compare financial impact across categories.  
- **Visual**: **Scatter Plot**  
  - **X-axis**: `RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_TYPE`.  
  - **Y-axis**: Sum of `RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT`.  
  - **Size**: Loss amount.  

#### **8. Detailed Incident Table**  
**Purpose**: Drill-down for auditors to inspect specifics.

    - `RISK_EVENT_LAST_UPDATE`  

---

### **Step 3: Add Interactivity**  
1. **Slicers**  
   - Add slicers for:  
     - `RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN`  
     - `RISK_EVENT_IMPACTED_COUNTRY`  
     - Date range (`RISK_EVENT_OCCURENCE_DATE`).  

2. **Tooltips**  
   - Configure tooltips to show incident descriptions (`RISKEVENTDESCRIPTION`) and action plans.  

3. **Drillthrough**  
   - Enable drillthrough from summary visuals (e.g., map, bar chart) to the detailed incident table.  

---

### **Step 4: Formatting and Layout**  
1. **Dashboard Theme**  
   - Use a professional color palette (e.g., red for high-risk, green for closed incidents).  

2. **Titles and Annotations**  
   - Add clear titles (e.g., "Incidents by Financial Impact").  
   - Use text boxes to explain key insights (e.g., "Top 3 processes account for 60% of incidents").  

3. **Mobile Layout**  
   - Optimize visuals for mobile viewing if auditors use tablets.  

---

### **Step 5: Publish and Share**  
1. **Publish to Power BI Service**  
   - Save the report and publish to Power BI Service for collaboration.  

2. **Set Up Data Refresh**  
   - Configure scheduled refresh if the dataset is updated regularly.  

3. **Export to PDF**  
   - Generate a PDF summary for audit reports.  

---

### **Example Insights for Auditors**  
1. **High Loss Incidents**: Filter to incidents where `RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT` > €1M.  
2. **Recurring Issues**: Use the `RISK_EVENT_AGGR_NO_OF_OCCURENCES` to flag repeat offenders.  
3. **Open vs. Closed**: Highlight unresolved incidents using the status filter.  

By following these steps, auditors can quickly identify high-risk areas, financial exposures, and trends to prioritize their audit activities.




I'll help you analyze this risk incident data and create meaningful visualizations in Power BI for auditors. Let me outline a detailed approach for creating visualizations that would effectively support an audit mission.

# Power BI Visualization Plan for Risk Incident Analysis

Based on the provided risk incident data, here are the steps to create meaningful visualizations in Power BI:

## Step 1: Data Import and Preparation

   - Create calculated columns for better analysis:
     - Time to close (days between RISK_EVENT_CREATION_DATE and RISK_EVENT_CLOSED_DATE)
     - Time to validate (days between RISK_EVENT_CREATION_DATE and RISK_EVENT_FIRST_VALIDATION_DATE)
     - Loss amounts categorization (create buckets based on amount ranges)
     - Extract month and quarter from dates for time-based analysis

## Step 2: Create a Risk Incident Dashboard

### Visualization 1: Risk Incident Status Overview
1. Create a card visual showing total number of incidents
2. Add a donut chart displaying distribution by RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN
3. Implement steps:
   - Drag "RISK_EVENT_STATUS_EN" to the Legend field
   - Use a count of RISK_EVENT_ID for the Values field
   - Format with appropriate colors (Red for Open, Yellow for Validated, Green for Closed)

### Visualization 2: Financial Impact Analysis
1. Create a bar chart showing total loss amounts by impact type:
   - Drag "RISK_EVENT_IMPACT_TYPE" to Axis
   - Drag "RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_GROSS_AMOUNT" to Values
   - Sort by amount in descending order

2. Add a matrix showing:
   - Rows: RISK_EVENT_MAIN_RESPONSIBLE_LRE
   - Columns: Sum of RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_GROSS_AMOUNT, RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_NET_AMOUNT, and RISK_EVENT_TOTAL_LOSS_FINAL_AMOUNT
   - Apply conditional formatting to highlight significant losses

### Visualization 3: Geographical Distribution
1. Create a map visualization:
   - Drag "RISK_EVENT_IMPACTED_COUNTRY" to Location
   - Use count of RISK_EVENT_ID or sum of loss amounts for the size of bubbles
   - Implement by using the Map visual and configuring country codes to work with Power BI's mapping

### Visualization 4: Time Series Analysis
1. Create a line chart showing incidents over time:
   - Drag "RISK_EVENT_REFERENCE_DATE" to Axis (formatted by month)
   - Drag count of RISK_EVENT_ID to Values
   - Add a trend line for pattern identification

2. Add a timeline slicer:
   - Drag "RISK_EVENT_REFERENCE_DATE" to a timeline slicer
   - Format to allow for flexible date range selection
   - Connect to all visuals for interactive filtering

### Visualization 5: Process and Activity Breakdown

1. Create cards or gauges for:
   - Average time to close incidents
   - Percentage of incidents with financial impact
   - Total loss amount against target/threshold
   - Incident recurrence rate

2. Implementation:
   - Use DAX measures to calculate these metrics
   - Create card visuals for each KPI
   - Add appropriate conditional formatting (red/yellow/green)

## Step 5: Create Audit-Specific Views

1. **Non-Compliance Report**:
   - Filter incidents related to regulatory penalties
   - Show trends over time
   - Highlight responsible departments

   - Provide context for key findings

Would you like me to explain any of these visualizations in more detail or provide additional recommendations for your audit support dashboard?








Below is a detailed, step‑by‑step guide to build a Power BI report that helps your auditors quickly understand last year’s risk incidents. We’ll cover everything from data ingestion and transformation, through model design and DAX calculations, to the creation of interactive visuals and final polishing.

⸻

1. Connect & Import the Data
	1.	Open Power BI Desktop
	2.	Get Data > Text/CSV (or Excel, SQL, as appropriate) and select your risk‑incident file.
	3.	In the Preview window, verify that Power BI has correctly detected:
	•	Date fields (RISK_EVENT_REFERENCE_DATE, …_OCCURRENCE_DATE, etc.)
	•	Numeric fields (…_TOTAL_LOSS_GROSS_AMOUNT, etc.)
	4.	Click Transform Data to enter Power Query for cleaning and shaping.

⸻

2. Transform & Shape in Power Query
	1.	Change Data Types
	•	Set all date columns to Date.
	•	Set loss‑amount columns to Decimal Number.
	•	Status and categorical codes to Text.
	2.	Filter Rows
	•	If you only want “last year” (e.g. 2024), filter RISK_EVENT_OCCURRENCE_DATE between 01/01/2024 and 12/31/2024.
	3.	Handle Missing Values
	•	Replace nulls in numeric loss amounts with 0 (Right‑click > Replace Values).
	•	For text fields like RISKEVENTTITLE, replace nulls with “(Unspecified)”.
	4.	Split or Extract
	•	If you need Year/Month out of a date, add a Date > Year and Date > Month columns from your occurrence date.
	5.	Rename Columns
	•	For clarity in the model, rename long column names to shorter aliases (e.g., Loss_Gross, Loss_Net, Status, Confidentiality).
	6.	Click Close & Apply.

⸻

3. Build the Data Model
	1.	In the Model view, confirm there is a single table of incidents (no relationships needed if this is your only table).
	2.	If you later bring in reference tables (e.g. process codes → process names), create relationships on key columns like RISK_EVENT_MAIN_PROCESS_CODE.

⸻

4. Create Key DAX Measures

In the Report view, under your incident table, right‑click New measure and add:

Total Incidents = COUNTROWS('Incidents')

Total Loss Gross = SUM('Incidents'[Loss_Gross])
Total Loss Net   = SUM('Incidents'[Loss_Net])
Total Loss Final = SUM('Incidents'[Loss_Final])

Avg Loss per Incident =
    DIVIDE([Total Loss Final], [Total Incidents], 0)

Optionally, measures for counts by status:

Open Incidents = CALCULATE([Total Incidents],
    'Incidents'[Status] = "Open")



⸻

5. Design Your Report Pages

Page 1: Executive Summary
	1.	Card visuals for
	•	Total Incidents
	•	Total Loss Final
	•	Avg Loss per Incident
	2.	Donut chart of Incident Count by Status.
	3.	Bar chart of Loss Final by Confidentiality level.
	4.	Slicer for Confidentiality and date (Year/Month).

Page 2: Trend Analysis
	1.	Line chart showing monthly Total Incidents (use the Year‑Month column on the axis).
	2.	Area chart of cumulative Loss Final over time.

Page 3: Process & Impact
	1.	Clustered bar chart: Number of incidents by Macro_Process_Code (or by Main_Process_Code).
	2.	Stacked bar: Loss Final by Impact_Type within each Macro Process.
	3.	Table or Matrix with details:
	•	RISK_EVENT_ID
	•	RISKEVENTTITLE
	•	Status, Loss_Final, Occurrence_Date

⸻

6. Add Interactivity & Drill‑Through
	1.	Enable Drill‑Down on charts by adding hierarchy (e.g. Year → Month → Day).
	2.	Drill‑through page: Right‑click on any incident in a table & drill through to a detail page that shows full description (RISKEVENTDESCRIPTION), action plan, timestamps.

⸻

7. Formatting & UX
	1.	Consistent color palette aligned to audit/audit‑brand (or use default theme).
	2.	Data labels on key bars/lines for clarity.
	3.	Tooltips: Customize to show additional fields like Service_Provider, Discovery_Date, etc.
	4.	Page Navigation Buttons: At bottom, add “Back to Summary” / “Next” buttons for the auditor’s workflow.

⸻

8. Validate & Publish
	1.	Review filters and interactions: ensure slicers cross‑filter appropriately.
	2.	Optimize performance: disable unnecessary visuals on load.
	3.	Publish to Power BI Service or export to PDF/PPT:
	•	For Power BI Service, assign appropriate roles and share with auditors.
	•	For PDF, use File > Export to PDF ensuring each page is legible.

⸻

Tips for Audit‑Ready Reporting
	•	Audit Trail: Include a “Last Refreshed” date textbox on every page.
	•	Annotations: Use text boxes to highlight key findings (e.g. “80% of losses occurred in Macro Process A”).
	•	Data Security: Apply row‑level security if confidentiality requires certain users to see only certain incidents.

By following these steps, your Power BI report will give auditors a clear, interactive view of risk incidents—helping them to slice, drill, and validate every aspect of your last‑year data.
