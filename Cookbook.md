### **Industry Applications**

#### **5. Which humanoid robot is being tested in BMW’s Spartanburg plant?**
**Options:**
- a) Tesla Optimus Gen 2  
- b) Figure 02 by FigureAI  
- c) Apollo by Apptronik  
- d) 1X’s NEO  

**Correct Answer:** b) Figure 02 by FigureAI  

**Explanation:**  
BMW has partnered with Figure AI to deploy humanoid robots in its Spartanburg, South Carolina plant, as announced in a January 2024 press release from Figure AI. The Figure 02 robot is designed for automotive manufacturing tasks, such as assembly and material handling, leveraging its human-like dexterity. Tesla Optimus Gen 2 is being developed for general-purpose tasks, primarily for Tesla’s own factories, with no specific mention of BMW deployment (per Tesla’s updates as of late 2024). Apollo by Apptronik has been explored for logistics and manufacturing, notably with Mercedes-Benz (Apptronik news, 2024), but not BMW’s Spartanburg facility. 1X’s NEO targets domestic and service applications, not automotive plants (1X Robotics, 2024). The distractors are plausible humanoid robots with industrial relevance, requiring specific knowledge of BMW’s partnerships to identify Figure 02.

#### **6. What is the primary goal of Agility Robotics’ Digit?**
**Options:**
- a) Autonomous last-mile delivery  
- b) Handling logistics tasks (e.g., moving totes in warehouses)  
- c) Precision assembly in automotive plants  
- d) Human-robot collaborative research  

**Correct Answer:** b) Handling logistics tasks (e.g., moving totes in warehouses)  

**Explanation:**  
Agility Robotics positions Digit as a humanoid robot optimized for logistics, with its primary goal being warehouse automation tasks like moving totes. According to Agility Robotics’ official site (2024) and a 2023 partnership announcement with Amazon, Digit excels at handling repetitive material movement in structured environments. While Digit has been tested for last-mile delivery (e.g., with Ford in 2019), this is a secondary application, not its core focus. Precision assembly is more suited to robots like those from Universal Robots, not Digit’s bipedal design. Human-robot collaboration is a broader research area, not Digit’s primary goal. These options challenge users to distinguish Digit’s specific purpose from other robotics applications.

#### **7. Disney Research plans to use Newton physics engine for:**
**Options:**
- a) Simulating lifelike motion in next-gen entertainment robots like BDX droids  
- b) Optimizing structural integrity of theme park rides  
- c) Real-time animation rendering for VR experiences  
- d) Predictive maintenance of robotic systems  

**Correct Answer:** a) Simulating lifelike motion in next-gen entertainment robots like BDX droids  

**Explanation:**  
Disney Research has utilized the Newton physics engine to simulate realistic movements for its entertainment robots, such as the BDX droids showcased at events like SXSW 2023. A 2023 Disney Research publication highlights its use in modeling dynamic, lifelike motion for small-scale humanoid robots used in theme parks. Optimizing ride structures typically involves finite element analysis tools, not physics engines like Newton (per engineering standards). Real-time VR rendering relies more on game engines like Unreal, while predictive maintenance uses data analytics, not physics simulations. These distractors align with Disney’s tech interests, making the question tougher by requiring knowledge of the BDX project.

#### **8. Which robot holds the record for the longest standing jump (1.4 meters)?**
**Options:**
- a) Atlas by Boston Dynamics  
- b) Unitree H1  
- c) Agility Robotics’ Cassie  
- d) GR-2 by Fourier Intelligence  

**Correct Answer:** b) Unitree H1  

**Explanation:**  
Unitree’s H1 humanoid robot set a world record for the longest standing jump by a humanoid, achieving approximately 1.4 meters, as demonstrated in a 2024 video release from Unitree Robotics. Atlas by Boston Dynamics is renowned for acrobatics, including jumps (e.g., parkour demos in 2018), but its recorded standing jump distance peaks around 1.2 meters, per public footage analysis. Cassie, a bipedal robot from Agility Robotics, excels at running, not jumping records (Agility, 2023). GR-2 by Fourier Intelligence focuses on rehabilitation, not dynamic feats (Fourier, 2024). The options test awareness of recent robotics milestones, with Atlas as a strong distractor due to its fame.

### **Technology & Challenges**

#### **9. What is "Physical AI"?**
**Options:**
- a) AI designed for real-time physics simulations in gaming  
- b) AI enabling robots to perceive and interact with the physical world  
- c) AI optimizing computational fluid dynamics  
- d) AI for modeling human biomechanics  

**Correct Answer:** b) AI enabling robots to perceive and interact with the physical world  

**Explanation:**  
Physical AI, as defined by industry leaders like NVIDIA (2024 keynote) and academic literature, refers to artificial intelligence that integrates perception, reasoning, and action to interact with the physical environment, typically via robots. Figure AI and Boston Dynamics emphasize this in their humanoid robot development. Gaming physics simulations (e.g., Unreal Engine) are distinct, focusing on virtual rendering. Computational fluid dynamics is a niche engineering application, while biomechanics modeling is a subset of AI research, not the broad definition of Physical AI. These distractors require understanding the term’s robotics-specific context.

#### **10. The main challenge for mass adoption of humanoid robots is:**
**Options:**
- a) Scalability of embodied learning algorithms  
- b) High cost and unreliable hardware durability  
- c) Insufficient computational power for real-time control  
- d) Regulatory restrictions on autonomous systems  

**Correct Answer:** b) High cost and unreliable hardware durability  

**Explanation:**  
High cost and hardware reliability are widely cited as the primary barriers to mass adoption of humanoid robots. A 2024 Robotics Business Review analysis notes that robots like Tesla Optimus and Figure 02 face production costs in the tens of thousands, with components like actuators prone to wear (e.g., Boston Dynamics’ Atlas maintenance challenges). Embodied learning scalability is a research hurdle but less immediate than cost, per MIT robotics studies (2023). Computational power is improving with edge AI chips (NVIDIA Jetson, 2024), and regulatory issues, while significant, vary by region and application. The distractors reflect real challenges, but cost and durability dominate current industry discourse.
